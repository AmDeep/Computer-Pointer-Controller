You may or may not choose to use it.  This contains an extension file (`.so`) that you might have to use to run the models.  ### The `bin` folder  This file contains a `MouseController` class that can help you control the mouse pointer. #### `mouse_controller.py`  The `face_detect.py` file contains a `FaceDetect` class meant for functions specific to the face detection model (for instance, formatting the inputs and outputs to the model). #### `model.py`  The `input_feeder.py` file contains a `InputFeeder` class meant to help you read input from files (video or image) or a webcam and then feed it into the model.  #### `input_feeder.py`  Make sure that you put all your code (apart from tests) in the `src` folder. The `src` folder has three files: `face_detect.py`, `input_feeder.py` and `mouse_controller.py`. ### The `src` folder  ```     â””â”€â”€ mouse_controller.py     â”œâ”€â”€ input_feeder.py     â”œâ”€â”€ model.py â””â”€â”€ src â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ libcpu_extension_sse4.so â”œâ”€â”€ bin â”œâ”€â”€ README.md ``` The starter code present in this repo will help you get started with your project. The code is setup as follows: ## Project Setup  - [ ] Make sure that you check out the project rubrics. The rubrics state what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing your project. - [ ] Clone the Github Repo available [here]() - [ ] Install OpenVino and all its dependencies  Before you actually get started with building your project, it might be helpful to check that you have done the following: ## Getting Started  - Model Documentation - [link](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_index.html) - Inference Engine API Docs - [link](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_inference_engine_ie_bridges_python_docs_api_overview.html) You may find these links useful to you when building your project: ## Useful Links  To complete this project you will need to be able to run multiple models in the same machine and coordinate the flow of data between those models.  </p> <img src=bin/model_flow.png width="450" height="450" /> <p align="center">  We will be using the InferenceEngine API from Intel's OpenVino ToolKit to build the project. The `gaze estimation` model requires three inputs: The head pose, the left eye image and the right eye image. To get these inputs, you will have to use three other OpenVino models: [Face Detection](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_face_detection_adas_binary_0001_description_face_detection_adas_binary_0001.html), [Head Pose Estimation](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_head_pose_estimation_adas_0001_description_head_pose_estimation_adas_0001.html) and [Facial Landmarks Detection](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_landmarks_regression_retail_0009_description_landmarks_regression_retail_0009.html). The flow of data through the models will look like this: ## How it works  [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O7u5gYcGzajRHAOro59-RvMavyTo_qm3) is a demo of the project. You can also get the video from the `bin` folder.  In this project, you will use a gaze detection model to control the mouse pointer of your computer. We will be using the [Gaze Estimation](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_gaze_estimation_adas_0002_description_gaze_estimation_adas_0002.html) model to estimate the gaze of the user's eyes and change the mouse pointer position accordingly.  # Computer Pointer Controller ad  Ï

If you have attempted any of the standout suggestions, make sure you include the specifications in the README. - [ ] README: The README file is an important part of the project requirements. Make sure that you complete the README file. - [ ] Implement a Pipeline: Using the `Inference Engine` API, you will need to build a pipeline that runs inference on the models using the inputs. The `src/face_detect.py` file contains a sample class for loading, checking and running inference on a single model. You will have to build similar files for the other three models. - [ ] Get Input Files: You can use a webcam stream as input to your model. If you do not have access to a webcam, make sure to download the video file. You will also need to download extension files provided in the `bin` folder and use them to load some of the models. - [ ] Download the models: You will need to use the gaze estimation model to move the mouse pointer. To run the gaze estimation model, you will need to use the outputs of three other models: face detection, landmark detection and head pose estimation. You will have to download these models using the model downloader.
